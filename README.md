# Homebound

The game is a fantasy game set at night in a rainy forest, you are a dwarven foreman tasked with rescuing the panicked miners before they are attacked by aggressive goblins. The player can control the foreman with the mouse, clicking a spot they wish the foreman to go to. All the while the scared miners will be running around in a panic, while goblins aggressively seek them and the player out. 

The player will be up against 5 goblins while trying to rescue 20 dwarves -- or any defined amount that you wish, up until 200!

If the goblins come in contact with the player, the player will be knocked slightly off course, 1 point will be deducted from the player and the goblins will let up their pursuit for a time. But if the goblins come in contact with a dwarf that dwarf will die and the goblin will score a point for the goblins. 

The objective of the game is to outscore the goblins by saving more dwarves than they can kill. 

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME THROUGH UNITY:

1. Open unity and set the scene to GameScene by going into the folder Assets/Scenes/
